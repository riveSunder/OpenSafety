# OpenI Safety Gym

This project is based on the capabilities of (OpenAI's safety gym)[https://openai.com/blog/safety-gym/], but uses PyBullet to encourage open research. 

Recognition to  [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org) and [Backyard Robotics](https://backyardrobotics.eu/2017/11/27/build-a-balancing-bot-with-openai-gym-pt-i-setting-up/) for cool tools and informative projects.
